                <p>Everyone says that, but we mean it. So, if when you take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and think, 'I'm a pretty good person' then by no means should you send us your cover letter, your resume, your book, your samples, your website or your links. BUT, if upon self-reflection you say to yourself 'I'm great people' then by all means, we should talk about one of the positions below. If none of the open positions feel quite right for your particular level of greatness, but you still think you could be our newest superstar, go ahead and submit your resume and info anyway, and we'll keep it for future consideration. Send your info to <a href="mailto:hr@meringcarson.com">hr@meringcarson.com</a>.</p>
                <p>No phone calls please. Truly great people don't need to follow-up. They're just. that. great.</p>
